Arrays :

1. Used when we need to manipulate data.
2. Used for ordered list of values (might contain duplicate)

Sets:

1. Used when we need to work with unique values
2.Used when high performence isreally important
3. Used to remove duplicates from an Arrays

-------------------------------------------------------

Objects :

1. Used when we need to include functions
2. Used when working with JSON data (can convert into map also)
3. Used we need key-value pair.


Maps :

1. Better performance easy to iterate and compute size
2. Keys have different data types
3. Used when we simply need to map key to values.
4. Used when we need keys, which are not strings.
