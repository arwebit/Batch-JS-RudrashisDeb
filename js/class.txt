Object Oriented Programming

Four fundamentals :

Abstraction: 
    Ignoring or hiding details that don't matter, allowing us to get an overview perspective
     of the things we are implementing, instead of messing with details that don't really matters 
     to our implementation.


Encapsulation: 
    Keeping private properties and methods inside the class, so they r not accessible outside of the class.
     Some methods can be exposed as a public interface (API).

Inheritance:
    Making all properties and methods of a certain class available to a child class, formaing a hierachical,
     relationship between classes, this allow us to reuse logic and to model real world relationships.

Polymorphism:
    A child class can overwrite a method it inherited from a parent class [it is more complicated than that, 
    but enough for our purpose ]. It describes the concept wherein you can use different classes with the same 
    interface. Each of these classes can provide its own implementation of the interface.
