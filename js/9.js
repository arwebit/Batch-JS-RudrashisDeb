// Topic : Functions

// Functions are the re-usuable codes that can be used more than once. The standard way of naming a
// function is in camelCase or small letters

//  "Write once, use many times"

// In JavaScript, there are three types of functions :

/*

 1. Declaration function (Normal functions that we use every time)
 2. Expression / Regular  function (It is used mostly in JS)
 3. Arrow function -- it is also used

 */

// Every function always returns a value, whethe we provide any value or not
